### 6.Tag
Assign Tags to whatever on your application
> You can Assign one tag or multiple tags within one text input and you can set the separator dynamically

### 7. Authorizing Users & Managing Roles.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Require the Package

After creating your new Laravel application you can include the Jarvis package with the following command: 

```bash
composer require sectheater/laravel-jarvis:dev-master
```

### 2. Add the DB Credentials & APP_URL

Next make sure to create a new database and add your database credentials to your .env file:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

You will also want to update your website URL inside of the `APP_URL` variable inside the .env file:

```
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Getting Your Environment Ready.

#### Just Run The following command.


```bash
	php artisan sectheater:install
```

##### Command Interpretation

1- It sets up your config file by registering whatever you confirm within the survey, in case you use *Everything* option that command supplies, the default configuration will be used. If you ever want to change anything , go to your config/jarvis.php and set whatever you need.
2- It will provide you a survey so the package sets up which features have to be enabled.
3- It also sets up the authentication routes.
> Jarvis doesn't depend on models at all, Everything runs through the repositories to provide you the best quality.

### 4. Sample Usage
##### 4.1 Registering A User 
Whenever you try to register a user, just supply Jarivs with the data and the slug of the role which you want to assign to this user
```bash
	Jarvis::registerWithRole($data,'user')
```
#### 4.2 Login A User

Logging a user is also an easy thing to do, just pass the data the user tries to attempt with , It can be username/email and password or whatever. Then if you want to remember the user , pass the second argument with true.
```bash
	Jarvis::registerWithRole($data,true)
```

#### 4.3 Checking For Roles.
<b> Let's assume I want to check whether the current logged in user has any permissions to create a post or not. It's worth mentioning that whenever you pass many elements to check on and the user has any of them, The method will return you a boolean value </b>
```bash
	Jarvis::User()->hasAnyRole(['create-post']) 
```
We are just checking here if the user has either creating permission under the user/moderator permissions.
```bash
	Jarvis::User()->hasAnyRole(['create-tag','moderator.create-tag']) 
/*
first permission determines what the role the user has and then check if he has this permission ,
second one checks if the user has moderator.create-tag and this should exist 
in users table permissions column,
as this doesn't exist in default roles table ( unless you add it )
*/
```

Sometimes, you want to check if a specific user has all of the roles , not just any of them.
Well That's also included.
```bash
	Jarvis::User()->hasAllRole(['create-post','edit-post'])
```
If you want to check on only one permission, you can pass that to the HasAnyRole within an array, Or just do it like the following.
```bash
	Jarvis::User()->hasRole('view-post')
```
If you want to check whether the user has any of the post permissions or whatever, you can do it like the following .
```bash
  // you can use the helper also
  jarvis()->user()->hasRole('*-post');
```
